# :globe_with_meridians: Hello World

This repository is designed to share knowledge about [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) and its concepts using real and small examples. **Everyone** can contribute, it doesn't matters if you're an expert senior NASA software engineer or not.

> :speech_balloon: Before you read more about this project, please read our principles above.

## :page_with_curl: Principles

- **If you can, make it simple.** The idea isn't show everything that you know but share what you know;
- **Try to explore as much details as possible when you are coding the example.** Think about who's reading your example. Probably they aren't thinking like you when reading the code;
- **Name your variables, classes, methods, args, everything correctly**. If your variable will store the locale date, you must name it as ```localeDate``` or anything that indicates its meaning;
- **Creativity is wellcome**. Show then a beautifull example using any UI style guide.
- **You're free**. Write about everything that concerns the React World;
